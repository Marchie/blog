## Stalk me online

* You can see where, how far and how fast I've been running on my [Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16803841).
* You can make unsolicited offers of employment via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-march-a59aaa176).
  I have all notifications turned off and the chances are I won't reply to you or follow you.
* You can see random pictures I have taken on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_marchie_/).
  I post very infrequently and randomly.
* I am no longer on Facebook. My day-to-day life is really quite uninteresting - and so is yours.
* I am no longer on Twitter. It is a platform that fosters conflict rather than constructive debate. It would also
  appear to be populated by either large numbers of automated bots, or more worryingly, large numbers of real people
  who behave in a similar way to automated bots.
